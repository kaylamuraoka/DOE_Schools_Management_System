# Employee_Management_System

## Problem

Spreadsheets are versitle powerful tools that companies use for everything from finance to marketing analytics. However, spreadsheets have its limitations, they're clunky, messy, and prone to human error.

#### The problem with using spreadsheets for your database:

1. They have security vulnerabilities. They have to be sent and shared in order for everyone in the company to access the data stored within, and that raises its own secuirity issues.
2. They are prone to human error.
3. They require more maintenance. Spreadsheets don't have a schema, meaning that they have loose rules for regulatingg how and where users input data.

Since spreadsheets tend to be more complex over time, they might not be serving your needs in the long term. Becasue of this, you may need to migrate to a more powerful type of database option - a DBMS (database management system). such as Microsoft Access or MySQL.

## Installation

#### Prerequisites and required applications

1. [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) is an implementation of the V8 JavaScript engine without Chrome that allows you to write server-side code using JavaScript. Therefore, you no longer neeed a browser to run JavaScript. You will need to have Node.js installed on your computer; you can follow the [**Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog**](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs) to install Node.js on your computer.

2. [**ExpressJS**](https://expressjs.com/) is built on top of node.js http module, and adds provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

3. [**MySQL**](https://www.mysql.com/) is a open-source relational database management system.

4. [**ECMAScript 6(ES^)**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp) standardised scripting language for JavaScript (JS).

5. [**Postman**](https://www.postman.com/) is a development tool which helps to build, test and modify APIs.It has the ability to make various types of HTTP requests(GET, POST, PUT, PATCH etc.).

6. IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger. I prefer to use [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

To install this project locally clone this [**project repository**](https://github.com/kaylamuraoka/Employee_Management_System) to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations. You may then modify the code to your liking. For steps on how to clone a repository using the command line, read this section of the GitHub Docs [**about cloning a repository**](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#about-cloning-a-repository).

You should run the following commands in the project folder:

```
// Initialise and Configure the Project with the command
npm init -y

// Now install the folling dependencies:
// Express
npm install express --save

// Body Parser
npm install body-parser --save

// MySQL
npm install mysql --save

// Nodemon
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```

You should now have a package.json file in your directory.
